To run a Processing sketch automatically when a Raspberry Pi boots up, you can set up a system service or modify the autostart settings. Here’s how you can do it:

### Option 1: Using `systemd` to create a service
`systemd` is the system and service manager for Linux. You can create a custom service to run your Processing sketch at boot.

1. **Write the Processing code**: Ensure that your Processing sketch is saved and ready to be executed. For example, save your sketch as `mySketch.pde` and compile it into an executable using Processing IDE.

2. **Compile the Processing Sketch**: In Processing, you can use the **Export Application** option to compile your sketch into a standalone application. 

   - Open the sketch in the Processing IDE.
   - Go to **Sketch → Export Application**.
   - Choose the operating system (Linux) and ensure that you get the `.elf` executable.

3. **Create a systemd service**:

   - Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Create a new service file for your sketch:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/run_processing_sketch.service
     ```
   
   - Add the following content to the file, adjusting the paths accordingly:
     ```ini
     [Unit]
     Description=Run Processing Sketch at Boot
     After=network.target

     [Service]
     ExecStart=/home/pi/processing-sketch/mySketch-linux-armv7l/mySketch
     WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/processing-sketch/mySketch-linux-armv7l
     User=pi
     Group=pi
     Restart=always

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```

   **Explanation of each section**:
   - `ExecStart`: The path to your compiled Processing sketch.
   - `WorkingDirectory`: The directory where your compiled sketch is located.
   - `User` and `Group`: The user and group that the sketch will run under (typically `pi` for Raspberry Pi).
   - `Restart`: Ensures the sketch restarts if it crashes.

4. **Enable and start the service**:
   After creating the service file, enable and start the service with the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable run_processing_sketch.service
   sudo systemctl start run_processing_sketch.service
   ```

5. **Reboot to test**:
   Now, reboot your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   Your Processing sketch should now run automatically on boot.

### Option 2: Using `~/.config/autostart` (GUI method)
If you're running a GUI on the Raspberry Pi, you can also set up the sketch to run automatically by adding it to the autostart folder.

1. **Prepare the executable**: Ensure your compiled Processing sketch is ready and placed in a directory (e.g., `/home/pi/processing-sketch/mySketch-linux-armv7l/`).

2. **Create an autostart entry**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
     nano ~/.config/autostart/processing-sketch.desktop
     ```
   - Add the following content to the file:
     ```ini
     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Processing Sketch
     Exec=/home/pi/processing-sketch/mySketch-linux-armv7l/mySketch
     Type=Application
     X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
     ```

3. **Reboot**:
   After saving the file, reboot your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

Your Processing sketch should now launch automatically after logging into the Raspberry Pi desktop.

Both methods should work depending on whether you're using the Raspberry Pi in a headless mode (Option 1) or with a GUI (Option 2). Let me know if you need further clarification!
